///
/// [Provider] is the equivalent of a [State.initState] combined with

This is likely a mistake, as Provider will not automatically update dependents
when $T is updated. Instead, consider changing Provider for more specific
implementation that handles the update mechanism, such as:

- ListenableProvider
- ChangeNotifierProvider
- ValueListenableProvider
- StreamProvider

Alternatively, if you are making your own provider, consider using InheritedProvider.

If you think that this is not an error, you can disable this check by setting
Provider.debugCheckInvalidValueType to `null` in your main file:

void main() {

This happens because you used a `BuildContext` that does not include the provider
of your choice. There are a few common scenarios:

- You added a new provider in your `main.dart` and performed a hot-reload.
  To fix, perform a hot-restart.

- The provider you are trying to read is in a different route.

  Providers are "scoped". So if you insert of provider inside a route, then
  other routes will not be able to access that provider.

- You used a `BuildContext` that is an ancestor of the provider you are trying to read.

  Make sure that $widgetType is under your MultiProvider/Provider<$valueType>.
  This usually happens when you are creating a provider and trying to read it immediately.

  For example, instead of:

  ```
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Provider<Example>(
      create: (_) => Example(),
      // Will throw a ProviderNotFoundError, because `context` is associated
      // to the widget that is the parent of `Provider<Example>`
      child: Text(context.watch<Example>()),
    ),
  }
  ```

  consider using `builder` like so:

  ```
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Provider<Example>(
      create: (_) => Example(),
      // we use `builder` to obtain a new `BuildContext` that has access to the provider
      builder: (context) {
        // No longer throws
        return Text(context.watch<Example>()),
      }
    ),
  }
  ```

  /// we will prefer to write:
